## Assessment Criteria

This rubric evaluates your lab submission across four key areas:
1.  **Correctness & Functionality** (Does it work?)
2.  **Code Quality & Readability** (Is it well-written?)
3.  **Logic & Problem-Solving** (Is the approach sound?)
4.  **Adherence to Requirements** (Did you follow instructions?)

## Grading Scale

| **Level** | **Points** | **Description** |
| --------------------- | :--------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Excellent** |  `90-100`  | Exceeds all requirements; demonstrates deep understanding and elegant code.   |
| **Good** |  `80-89`   | Meets all requirements; code is functional and well-written.                 |
| **Satisfactory** |  `70-79`   | Meets most requirements; minor errors or areas for improvement exist.        |
| **Needs Improvement** |  `60-69`   | Fails to meet several key requirements; significant errors or misconceptions. |
| **Unsatisfactory** |   `< 60`   | The submission is incomplete or fundamentally flawed.                        |

## Detailed Rubric

### 1. Correctness & Functionality (40 Points)

| **Level** | **Points** | **Description** |
| --------------------- | :--------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Excellent** |  `36-40`   | Program compiles without errors or warnings. Produces correct output for all test cases, including edge cases. |
| **Good** |  `32-35`   | Program compiles and runs. Produces correct output for most standard test cases. Minor errors on edge cases.   |
| **Satisfactory** |  `28-31`   | Program compiles, but may have minor runtime errors. Output is mostly correct but fails on several test cases. |
| **Needs Improvement** |  `24-27`   | Program fails to compile or has significant runtime errors. Output is consistently incorrect.                |
| **Unsatisfactory** |   `< 24`   | Program is non-functional or does not compile at all.                                                        |

### 2. Code Quality & Readability (30 Points)

| **Level** | **Points** | **Description** |
| --------------------- | :--------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Excellent** |  `27-30`   | Code is clean, well-formatted, and easy to follow. Uses meaningful variable names. Includes clear and concise comments. |
| **Good** |  `24-26`   | Code is readable with consistent formatting. Variable names are adequate. Some comments are present where needed.      |
| **Satisfactory** |  `21-23`   | Code has inconsistent formatting or unclear variable names, making it somewhat difficult to read. Comments are sparse. |
| **Needs Improvement** |  `18-20`   | Code is poorly formatted and very difficult to understand. No meaningful variable names or comments.                 |
| **Unsatisfactory** |   `< 18`   | Code is a single block of unformatted text; completely unreadable.                                                     |

### 3. Logic & Problem-Solving (20 Points)

| **Level** | **Points** | **Description** |
| --------------------- | :--------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Excellent** |  `18-20`   | The chosen algorithm is efficient and elegant. Demonstrates a deep understanding of the underlying concepts.       |
| **Good** |  `16-17`   | The logic is sound and effectively solves the problem. The implementation is correct and logical.                |
| **Satisfactory** |  `14-15`   | The logic has minor flaws or is unnecessarily complex, but it generally works.                                   |
| **Needs Improvement** |  `12-13`   | The approach contains significant logical errors. The student's understanding of the problem seems limited.      |
| **Unsatisfactory** |   `< 12`   | The logic is fundamentally flawed or completely missing.                                                         |

### 4. Adherence to Requirements (10 Points)

| **Level** | **Points** | **Description** |
| --------------------- | :--------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Excellent** |   `10`     | All submission instructions were followed perfectly (e.g., file naming, format, including a README if required). |
| **Good** |    `8-9`   | Minor deviation from one instruction (e.g., slightly incorrect file name).                                       |
| **Satisfactory** |    `7`     | Multiple minor deviations from instructions.                                                                     |
| **Needs Improvement** |    `6`     | A major requirement was missed (e.g., wrong file type submitted).                                                |
| **Unsatisfactory** |    `< 6`   | Submission instructions were largely ignored.                                                                    |
