## Exercise 1: Array Memory & Indexing

*   **Task:** Write a program to explore the memory layout of 1D and 2D arrays. This helps visualize how arrays are stored contiguously in memory.
:: left ::
*   **Part A: 1D Array**
    1.  Declare an integer array, e.g., `int data[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};`.
    2.  Print the size of the entire array in bytes using `sizeof(data)`.
    3.  Print the size of a single element in bytes using `sizeof(data[0])`.
    4.  Use a `for` loop to print the `index`, `value`, and memory `address` (`&data[i]`) of each element. Use the `%p` format specifier to print addresses.
    5.  **Question:** What is the difference in the memory address between `data[0]` and `data[3]`?
:: right ::
*   **Part B: 2D Array**
    1.  Declare a 2D integer array, e.g., `int matrix[2][3] = {{11, 22, 33}, {44, 55, 66}};`.
    2.  Print the total size of the matrix in bytes using `sizeof(matrix)`.
    3.  Use nested `for` loops to print the `index (r, c)`, `value`, and memory `address` (`&matrix[r][c]`) of each element.
    4.  **Question:** Observe the memory addresses. Are the elements of the first row (`matrix[0]`) stored right before the elements of the second row (`matrix[1]`)?

## Exercise 2: Student Scores Analysis

*   **Task:** Write a program with functions to analyze an array of student scores.
*   **üìù Flowchart First:** Draw a flowchart for the `findMax` function.
*   **Requirements:**
    1.  In `main`, create a `float` array and initialize it with some scores (e.g., `float scores[] = {88.5, 92.0, 76.5, 95.0, 83.0};`).
    2.  Implement a function `float findSum(float arr[], int size)` that returns the sum of all scores.
    3.  Implement a function `float findMax(float arr[], int size)` that returns the highest score.
    4.  Implement a function `float findMin(float arr[], int size)` that returns the lowest score.
    5.  In `main`, call these functions and use their results to print the sum, average, maximum, and minimum scores.

## Exercise 3: Statistical Analysis: Mean, Median, and Mode

*   **Task:** Write a program to calculate the mean, median, and mode of a dataset. This is a very common task in data analysis.
*   **üìù Flowchart First:** Draw a flowchart for the logic to find the **mode**.
*   **Requirements:**
    1.  In `main`, create an integer array, e.g., `int data[] = {7, 2, 8, 2, 9, 2, 7, 4, 5};`.
    2.  **Mean:** Calculate the sum of all elements and divide by the number of elements. Print this value as a `float`.
    3.  **Mode:** The value that appears most frequently.
        *   Use a second array, `frequency[10]`, to count the occurrences of each number (assuming numbers are 0-9).
    4.  **Median:** The middle value of a *sorted* dataset.
        *   To find the median, you must first sort the `data` array, you can apply the frequency counting concept for sorting.
    5.  Print the calculated mean, median, and mode.

## Exercise 4: Print a Dice Face (2D Array)

:: left ::

*   **Task:** Write a program that asks the user for a number from 1 to 6 and prints the corresponding face of a die using a 2D array.
*   **üìù Flowchart First:** Draw a flowchart that shows how the program gets user input and uses a selection structure (like a `switch`) to determine which dice face to print.

*   **Requirements:**
    1.  In `main`, prompt the user to enter an integer from 1 to 6.
    2.  Define a 2D array, `int diceFace[3][3]`.
    3.  Use a `switch` statement based on the user's input to populate the `diceFace` array with the correct pattern of 1s (dots) and 0s (blanks).
:: right ::
 
4.  Write a function `void printGrid(int grid[][3], int rows)` that takes the 2D array and prints it.
5.  The function should use nested loops to iterate through the grid. It should print a `* ` (star and space) for a `1` and `  ` (two spaces) for a `0`.
6.  Call `printGrid` from `main` to display the chosen dice face.
7.  Include a `default` case in your `switch` to handle invalid input (numbers not between 1 and 6).
*   **Example Output (for input 5):**
    ```text
    *   * 
      *   
    *   * 
    ```

## Exercise 5: Bubble Sort in a Function

*   **Task:** Implement the Bubble Sort algorithm within a function to sort an integer array in ascending order.
*   **Function Signature:** `void bubbleSort(int arr[], int size)`
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  Use a nested loop. The outer loop iterates from the end of the array towards the beginning.
    2.  The inner loop "bubbles up" the largest element to its correct position in each pass.
    3.  It does this by comparing adjacent elements (`arr[j]` and `arr[j+1]`) and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
*   **Requirements:**
    1.  Implement the `bubbleSort` function. It should modify the array directly (in-place).
    2.  Create a helper function `void printArray(int arr[], int size)` to display array contents.
    3.  In `main`, create an unsorted array, print it, call `bubbleSort`, and print the sorted array.

## Exercise 6: Matrix Addition

*   **Task:** Write a function that performs matrix addition on two 2D arrays.
*   **üìù Flowchart First:** Draw a flowchart for the `addMatrices` function.
*   **Requirements:**
    1.  Use `#define` to set `ROWS` and `COLS` for your matrices (e.g., 2 rows, 3 columns).
    2.  In `main`, define and initialize two 2D integer arrays, `matrixA` and `matrixB`.
    3.  Declare a third 2D array, `sumMatrix`, to store the result.
    4.  Implement a function `void addMatrices(int A[][COLS], int B[][COLS], int C[][COLS], int rows)`.
    5.  Inside `addMatrices`, use nested loops to calculate `C[r][c] = A[r][c] + B[r][c]` for each element.
    6.  Create a helper function `void printMatrix(int M[][COLS], int rows)` to display a matrix.
    7.  In `main`, call `addMatrices` and then `printMatrix` to display the `sumMatrix`.
